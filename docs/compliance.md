# Compliance

Below tables contain statements from [RFC7643](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7643) 
and [RFC7644](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644) (sometimes redacted, to make them easier to understand without the full context).

For every statement there is an information if a particular desired behavior is validated by `scimpler` or / and if
it is supported by the packaged classes and functions.

`scimpler` provides almost stateless validation (it uses few in-memory registries for smooth usage),
so it works best for syntax and part of semantics validation. Any behavior that spans on multiple
SCIM operations (e.g., value uniqueness)m or requires to correlate requests with responses, is not
validated and should be ensured by you. 

The :heavy_check_mark: symbol means that the desired behavior is validated / supported. The :x: symbol means the opposite. 
No symbol means the statement is irrelevant or too abstract and can not be efficiently validated / supported.

!!! info
    You are free to use the tables as check-lists to make sure your implementation is compliant with SCIM 2.0.

For more information about `scimpler` capabilities, see
[User's Guide](users_guide.md) and API Reference.

| Multi-tenancy is optional. The SCIM protocol does not define a scheme for multi-tenancy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |           |           |
| The SCIM protocol deos not prescribe the mechanisms whereby clients and service providers interact for: 1. Registering or provisioning Tenants, 2. Associating a subset of clients with a subset of the Tenants, 3. Indicating which tenant is associated with the data in a request or response, or indicating which Tenant is the subject of a query. |           |           |
| The service provider **MAY** use one of the authentication mechanisms to determine the identity of the client and thus infer the associated Tenant.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |           |           |
| For implementations where a client is associated with more than one Tenant, the service provider **MAY** use one of the three methods for explicit specification of the Tenant: 1. A URL prefix: `https://www.example.com/Tenants/{tenant_id}/v2/Users`, 2. A sub-domain: `https://{tenant_id}.example.com/v2/Groups`, 3. An HTTP header.               |           |           |
| The service provider may choose to implement SCIM ids that are unique across all resources for all Tenants, but this is not required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |           |           |
| The `externalId`, defined by the client, is required to be unique ONLY within the resources associated with the associated Tenant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |           |           |

| SCIM clients requesting information using query filters that use HTTP GET **SHOULD** give consideration to the information content of the filters and whether or not their exposure in a URI would represent a breach of security or confidentiality through leakage in web browsers or server logs. |           |           |
| For information that is legally considered "personally identifiable information", clients **SHOULD** query using HTTP POST.                                                                                                                                                                          |           |           |

| For anonymous requests, the service provider **MAY** try to authenticate web user interface components that formulate the SCIM creation request (e.g. CAPTCHA).                                                                                                                                      |           |           |
| For anonymous requests, the service provider **MAY** limit the number of requests that any particular client **MAY** make in a period of time.                                                                                                                                                       |           |           |
| For anonymous requests, for User resources, the service provider **MAY** default newly created resources with an `active` setting of `false`, and use a secondary confirmation process (e.g., email confirmation) to ensure that the resource created is real.                                       |           |           |
| Service providers **SHOULD** follow recommendations outlined in RFC6819 for secure storage and handling of sensitive data.                                                                                                                                                                           |           |           |
| Service providers **SHOULD** define an access control model that differentiates between individual client applications and their specific need to access information, and any User self-service rights to review and update personal profile information.                                            |           |           |
